Create an API with Vert.x (here's one I made earlier)
Check its throughput (using 1 CPU)
Profile #threads, memory

Create a web front-end using Jetty which calls the API (set threadpool to 1)
Check its throughput
Profile #threads, memory

Make the API slower
Check its throughput - still OK
Profile #threads, memory

Check the web front-end throughput - not OK!
Increase the web front-end number of threads - still not OK
Profile #threads, memory

Replace the web front-end with Vert.x
Check its throughput - OK
Profile #threads, memory

Describe tradeoffs:
    code complexity
    OS resources
